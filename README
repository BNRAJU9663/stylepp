style per partes

stylepp is a tool to maintain consistent style. 

It consist of independent programs that can be used as needed.

A two basic workflows are possible.

First run inital cleanuup over codebase, this separate formatting changes 
from code changes.

Then to maintain consistent state you need either add appropriate hook 
or run formatter periodicaly.

You need to specify which files are stylepp responsibility. Currently this is done by 
placing file .indent.on to each directory you want to format.
